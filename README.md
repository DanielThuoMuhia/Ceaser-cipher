# Caesar Cipher

## Overview

The Caesar Cipher is a classic encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. This simple substitution cipher is named after Julius Caesar, who used it to encrypt his private messages.

This project implements a Caesar Cipher in Python. It allows you to encode and decode messages with a customizable shift amount.

## Features

- Encode and decode messages using the Caesar Cipher.
- Handle both lowercase and uppercase letters.
- Preserve the case of letters in the original message.
- Input validation for shift amount and cipher direction.
